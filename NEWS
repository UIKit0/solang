0.4 - 2010-01-22

New Features:

* Replaced our own database with Tracker. SPARQL is used to gain
  access to the meta information about the photos. Photos are in the
  Nepomuk desktop ontology represented by the class nmm:Photo [1].
  Tags are in the same ontology represented in its annotation
  section [2]. They are represented by the class nao:Tag.
* The folder importer is now obsolete and has been removed because
  Tracker automatically indexes all photos on the system.
* Photo meta-data are now obtained from Tracker instead of reading
  Exif directly.
* Improved thumbnail management. Rely on an implementation of the
  Thumbnail Management Specification [3], such as Tumbler, for creating
  thumbnails. Created thumbnails are now stored according to the
  Thumbnail Managing Standard [4].
* No separate editor renderer. Photos can now be edited directly in
  the enlarged renderer.
* Moved the UI controls for the browser render's pagination bar and
  zoomer to more standard locations. The previous and next buttons,
  and slider are now part of the main toolbar, while the currently
  displayed range is indicated in the status bar.
* UI cleanup. No text is shown in the thumbnail view and all additions
  or removals to the search basket are now automatic.
* New dependencies on GEGLmm, Tracker, D-Bus GLib and the
  org.freedesktop.thumbnails.xxx D-Bus services. Minimum required
  version of GEGL is 0.1.x.
* Dropped dependencies on Exiv2, Flickcurl, LibGdamm, LibGPhoto2,
  LibSoup and WebKit Gtk+.

Regressions:

* Camera and Flickr importers are absent.
* There is no date view or searching based on dates.
* Changes made to photos can not be saved and there is no undo/redo.
* The scale, brightness, contrast and saturation operations are missing
  from the editor.
* Tags do not have an icon associated with them.

Translations:

* Added translations:
  - Bengali (India) (bn_IN)
  - French (fr)
  - Hebrew (he)
  - Polish (pl)
